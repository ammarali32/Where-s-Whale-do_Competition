# Where-s-Whale-do_Competition
For this competition, your goal is to identify which images in a database contain the same individual beluga whale seen in a query image.

You will be provided with a set of queries, each one specifying a single query image of a beluga whale and a corresponding database to search for matches to that same individual. The database will include images of both matching and non-matching belugas. This is a learning-to-rank information retrieval task.
